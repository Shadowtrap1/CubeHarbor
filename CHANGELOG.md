# Changelog

All notable changes are listed here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0: minor versions may break things).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

* Operator: port names and container ports are checked before anything is applied, so colliding
  or invalid ports (e.g. two long names cut to the same 15 characters, or an extra port reusing
  the voice chat port) give a clear status message instead of repeated API errors.

## [0.1.0]

First public release.

* Operator for `MinecraftServer` resources: version resolution, Java image selection, install
  plans, public port allocation, auto-sleep.
* Hostname-routing gateway with sleeping-server status replies, wake-on-join, and TCP/UDP
  forwarding for voice chat and Bedrock. Optional itzg/mc-router mode.
* Installer for vanilla, Paper, Purpur, Fabric, Quilt, Forge, NeoForge, Modrinth and CurseForge
  modpacks, with client-only mod detection.
* Dashboard: quick create, compose import/export, live logs, RCON console, `/api/v1`, and
  customizable branding/theme (`dashboard.site`).
* `cubeharbor` CLI and a Helm chart.
* Cluster portability settings: IPv6/dual-stack (`network.*`), OpenShift-friendly security
  contexts, NodePort-mapped allocated ports, server pod defaults (`serverPods.*`: pull secrets,
  node selection, tolerations, priority), gateway PodDisruptionBudget and topology spread.
* Hardened defaults: `spec.image` overrides are off unless `minecraft.allowImageOverride` is
  set, RCON is limited to the dashboard by a NetworkPolicy, and dashboard sessions live in memory
  (users log in again after the dashboard restarts).
